          ECC memory is higher cost, as each bank is 9 memory chips
          compared to 8 for non-ECC memory.

DIMM：

* UDIMM: Unbuffered DIMM. Unbuffered, low density, low-latency DIMM that
  doesn't include a register or buffer chip. Generally used in applications
  requiring the lowest possible latency.
* RDIMM: Registered DIMM. Registered DIMM that provides high signal integrity
  (performing parity checking to detect improper addresses or commands) and
  increased performance for heavy workloads. RDIMMs experience slightly
  increased latency and power consumption over UDIMMs due to the onboard
  register.
* LRDIMM: Uses a buffer to reduce memory loading to a single load on all
  DDR signals, allowing for greater density.

电压：

* Standard Voltage (SV) DDR3 operates at 1.5 volts which is currently
  required for 1600 million transfers per second (MT/s)
* Low Voltage (LV) DDR3 operates at 1.35 volts or 1.5 volts. At 1.35 volts
  the memory can consume less power and reduce heat, but can still be boosted
  to 1.5V when the memory channel requires additional voltage to help maintain
  maximum speed.

工作模式：

* Advanced ECC mode (otherwise known as lockstep mode) uses two memory
  channels and "ties" them together to emulate a 128-bit data bus DIMM.
  This is primarily used to achieve Single Device Data Correction (SDDC)
  for DIMMs based on x8 DRAM technology. SDDC is supported with x4 based
  DIMMs in every memory mode.
* Memory Optimized mode (or Independent Channel mode) allows memory channels
  to run independently of each other; for example, one can be idle, one can be
  performing a write operation, and the other can be preparing for a read
  operation. Memory may be installed in one, two, three, or four channels.
  To fully realize the performance benefit of the memory optimized mode,
  all four channels per physical processor should be populated.
* Memory Mirroring mode allows memory to be "mirrored" from one channel into
  a paired channel. This provides 100% memory redundancy, but cuts the
  available memory to the operating system in half in addition to halving the
  available memory controllers and channels. This will have a direct impact on
  memory bandwidth, which should see less than half the memory bandwidth as
  compared to memory Optimized mode. This will have seriously negative
  performance implications, and should only be considered for applications
  that require mission critical levels of memory :term:`RAS`.
* Memory Rank Sparing mode reserves a memory rank as a spare as long as there
  are at least 2 DIMMs or 4 ranks available in a memory channel. If a memory
  rank experiences a high number of correctable errors above a certain
  threshold, the memory controller will swap the failing rank with the
  spare rank. The spare rank is invisible to the operating system, thus
  overall memory available to the operating system is decreased.
